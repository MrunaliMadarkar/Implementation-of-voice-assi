The implementation of voice assistant for  weather forecasting  

 Weather forecasting is one of the applications of science and technology to predict 
atmospheric conditions at a particular place and time. People have been trying to predict the 
weather informally for thousands of years, but have been doing so formally since the 19th 
century. Weather forecasting is performed by collecting quantitative data about current 
atmospheric, land, and sea conditions and using meteorology to predict how the atmosphere 
will change at a particular location. 
Weather has become a very important aspect of our daily activities. Our daily 
activities are largely dependent on the weather outside. Whether it's cloudy, rainy, extremely 
hot or cold, the weather forecast will give you information about it. When I left the house, it 
started to rain. "Weather Forecast Report" helps you know what the weather forecast will be 
for today to solve these problems.
